# AVIATION RISK ASSESSMENT 

# A detailed analysis of aviation data by NTSB Aviation Accident Data (1962–2023) to determine Aircraft with the lowest risks 



# Overview 
The company, has been looking forward to diversifying its  operations into the aviation industry. However, there is no information available on the potential risks associated with this new venture. 
Therefore, this project aims to analyze historical aviation accident data utilizing the NTSB data from 1962 to 2023 to identify aircraft models, makes, and engines that have the lowest risk profile based on injury fatalities. 
The results of this data analysis should assist the Head of Aviation Division in determining which is the most appropriate venture within the aviation industry

# Business Understanding 

The company has prospered in the Electric vehicle industry over the past 10years. To combat the potential decline of the company, the stakeholders have sought to venture into the aviation industry. The aviation industry, however, is exposed to significant risks, one of which is accidents. For success within this industry, the company needs to understand the accident risks associated with different aircraft makes and models. 

The NTSB provides a relevant dataset collected over a period of time that new companies can rely on for better decision-making as they venture into the aviation industry. 
Research shows that data-driven decision-making results in better and informed decisions. 

## Project Objectives 

*To analyze Aircraft Makes with the Lowest Fatality Rates

*To identify which Aircraft Engine types are more prone to damage in case of accidents 

*Which Purpose Flights are less risky to fatal accidents 


# DATA UNDERSTANDING 
Data Source:  Aviation Data from 1962 to 2023 on civil aviation accidents across accidents and selected incidents across the United States and international waters 

Data from the National Transportation Safety Board 

The dataset contains 90348 rows of data and 31 columns of data 
Some significant columns for the  company’s risk assessment include: 

Aircraft Make- different aircraft makes, i.e., Cessna, 

Aircraft Model- different makes such as Cessna, PIPER, Beech, BOEING 

Aircraft Damage- extent of damage  substantial, destroyed, and others not given 

Purpose of Flight- various uses of flights ( personal, business, skydiving, executive,  
firefighting), etc. 

Total Fatal injuries- total number of fatal injuries in a specific accident event 

Injury Severity  

# Data Analysis and Visualizations 
### Which Aircraft make has the lowest total fatal injuries?

From the visual on the top 10 makes by total fatal injuries, it is evident that Cessna has the highest risk of fatal injuries, with models such as FOKKER having the lowest fatality 

Recommendation 
It is hence recommended that, as the Head of Aviation Division, Fokker aircraft make are advised as they have low total fatal injuries.
